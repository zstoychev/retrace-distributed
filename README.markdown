# Distributed raytracer

Made the raytracer from svn://anrieff.no-ip.org/retrace distributed. The raytracer was developed as part of a raytracing course. The courseâ€™s site is [http://raytracing-bg.net](http://raytracing-bg.net).

The project depends on the [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) and [SDL_net](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/) libs.
